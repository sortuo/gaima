**The Gaima part of the code is in experimental stage, please feel free to comment.**

A 3d platform that has Java Monkay Engine, jme Physics and Java Object Oriented Neural Engine (Joone) combined.

This platform connects physical representations to neural network manager. This manager is able to control the objects in movement in 3d physical representation.

Here are videos of testing the framework. [Video 1 Basic testing of physics platform](http://gaima.googlecode.com/files/first_low.mpeg) [Video 2 Testing of keeping shape in fixed position - No NN in use](http://gaima.googlecode.com/files/force_low.mpeg)

TODO: Neural network can learn to move joints so that object balancing is possible.

Contact me if you are interested in this project development. Please leave a comment on the Wiki page.

Requires:
- Download source code

- Java 6 SE http://java.sun.com

- Java Monkey Engine - JME Physics 2.1 https://jmephysics.dev.java.net
Download: https://jmephysics.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8419

- Java Object Oriented Neural Engine - JOONE 2.0.0 http://sourceforge.net/projects/joone
Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/joone/files/joone-editor/2.0.0RC1/JooneEditor2.0.0RC1-Win-NoVM.exe/download

Currently in progress: Goal is to achieve desired object movements with the assistance of neural network.
